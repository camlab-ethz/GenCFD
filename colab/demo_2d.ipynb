    "# GenCFD 2D Demo\n",
    "\n",
    "This demo showcases how the GenCFD diffusion model can be used as a surrogate model to solve the 2D wave equation, utilizing a sine basis representation. The wave equation is a second-order linear partial differential equation (PDE) that describes the evolution of waves or standing wave fields. Examples include sound waves, seismic waves, or other wave-like phenomena arising in fields such as acoustics, electromagnetism, or fluid dynamics.\n",
